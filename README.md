# Welcome to Pages

A website demonstrating Django's built-in authentication system. Why pages? This is a minimal website containing different html templates in the form of pages corresponding to each auth operation.

I have used Django 5.x, python 3.11.x and bootstrap 5.3 for this application.

All the libraries and modules used in this project are up-to-date. (refer to requirements.txt for more info)

Pages:
-
1. Login page
2. Signup page
3. Forgot password page
4. Home page (dashboard)
5. Profile page
6. Change password page

Forms:
-
1. UserCreationForm
2. AuthenticationForm
3. PasswordChangeForm
4. PasswordResetForm

Note that the default User model has been used throughout the project for simplicity.

The application utilizes function-based-views.
